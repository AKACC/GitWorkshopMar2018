# GitWorkshopMar2018

The workshop for Seneca ICT students is being held in room DB2108 on the 1st of March 2018 in the Victor Phillip Dahdaleh (a.k.a. TEL) building. It will start at 13:00 and go for three hours, until 16:00.

If you want to attend, you need to follow these steps to let us know to expect you:

* Create a GitHub account if you don't already have one: https://github.com/
* Log in, and come back to this page: https://github.com/Seneca-CDOT/GitWorkshopMar2018
* Click the "Watch" button on the top right, and select "Watching"

Please do this as soon as possible: that way we will know that we have enough room for everyone who wants to attend.

The workshop is intended for Seneca ICT students but everyone is welcome to attend. Just be aware that you'll need to bring your own laptop if you don't have a Seneca account to use lab computers.

If you have any questions, please contact andrew.smith at senecacollege.ca by email
